Airport
We have a Central Dashboard for all flights and individual Airport Dashboard for Airports.

Take some records manually in flightdata.json file.

Now Central Dashboard display all flight details, let say we have data of 5 flights.

For Airport Dashboard, you can enter flight no. and once Search button is clicked it list From and To Details of flight in display. 

You can update Estimated Arrival & Estimated Departure of flight and press Update button. It would update central database and hence Central Dashboard would update and display changes in realtime.

Status field in Central Dashboard would show statuses like

On Time
Arriving Late By 30mins
Arriving Early By 30mins
Departing Late By 30mins
Departing Early By 30mins
Departed


Depending on Time Entered and Actual Time of user.

You can open 1 Browser Tab for Central Dashboard and multiple tabs on same browser for Airport Dashboards.

Whatever changes you make in Airport Dashboards it reflect back in Central Dashboard automatically with jQuery Ajax.
